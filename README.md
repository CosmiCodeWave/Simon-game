Simon Game Project
Welcome to the Simon Game, a classic memory game where players are challenged to remember and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. This project is part of my programming journey, created to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and most importantly, JavaScript. By building this game, I've honed my abilities in front-end development, user experience design, and interactive programming. Feel free to explore the game and my progress in the world of programming.
